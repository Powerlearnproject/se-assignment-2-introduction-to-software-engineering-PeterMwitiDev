# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
__It is the application of  engineering principles in creating a software.Involve's design,developing,testing and maintaing.__

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
__software engineerng is application of engineering priciplesin creating a software. It deffer from tradional since it focuses on the entire lifecycle(SDLC).__

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
 __Planning : Define the scope and pupose of the project.
   Requirement : this are the need of the users and stackholders.
   Design : Define the architecture of the systeme.guser interface.
   Implementation: Writing code and building the software.
   Testing: system shoul meet the quality standard.
   Deployment:releasing software to the user or customer
   Maintainance:Continuour enhancement of the system.__
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
__Agile is iterative while waterfall is linear.
Agile is adaptable to changes while waterfall has low changes.
Agile has continuos regular feedback while waterfall hass limited feedback.
Agile testing occurs through out development while waterfall testing occurs afterimplementation.
(Agile might be good for dinamic projects while waterfall for well defined projects)__
Requirements Engineering:
What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
__Refers to the process of gathering analising,managing and documenting all need of stakeholders project.
Process involves: 
   Elictation- gathering requirement through interviews,surveys and observations
   analysis- analizing requiements
   Specification - Docummenting the requiments clearly
   Validation - ensureringrequirement meet stake holders needs
   management-handling changesto the requirment.
Importance include : Clarity,risk reduction,better estimation of time lines and good management of the project__
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
